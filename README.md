# Andira Rahman (a.k.a Pangkualam Singodimejo)
Fair Greetings, Wanderer! for a moment spared, my tale shall be yours to remember. Even if it's only in that very moment spared...
## Tales of Past and Present
I hail from the distant islands that counts in the thousands, quite a ways south of the Land of Sun and a tad to the west.
The bountiful archipelago known as Indonesia. I am proud to call its Silver Cape town of Surabaya home.
If thy so wish to refer to me when conversing with others, I beg thee use the correct pronouns of ***He/Him*** or ***They/Them***.
As of the year of our lord 2024, I have spent almost quarter of a century in these lands. Born on a Mayday of the Final Year of the First Gregorian Millenium.
I traverse in this strange domain of bits with the tools of the commonfolks, Windows. Yet, the intrigue of this *Linux* escapes me not.
I scale the web that spans worldwide and even learn the languages that shape it, the trinity of *HTML*, *CSS*, and *Javascript*.
And among many things, I am fond of linguistic theatrics, as one can guess by now...
Tales, Songs, and Strokes of the Brush. These are the things that makes life worth living indeed.
## Dreams of What Is Yet To Come
The world has become such a wonderful yet confusing place.
I dream of only the humblest dream.
I dream of a world where each voice matters and is being heard as equally as possible.
I dream of a world where the abundance of the world is distributed more evenly.
I dream of a place to call home, a small comfortable abode with a partner and some flora and/or fauna.
I dream to engage in and deliver joy with and to my community.
I dream of conversing in the tongue of the land of the Sun, the desserts of Arabia, and much more.
I dream of creating sheets of creative and interactive windows upon the world wide web.
I dream of a belly full, head empty, shoulders wide, and hips thin.
But most of all,
I dream of everlasting ***Joy***.
and I wish that upon friends, enemies, and strangers alike.

## TL;DR
I (He/They) am a fairly young, dramatic, creative, and perpetually daydreaming web developer from Surabaya, Indonesia currently learning the ways of the web with fun technologies such as Svelte and Sveltekit. I love reading, writing, singing, dancing, and in general just experiencing the world around me and recounting those experiences with personal flair. I hope you enjoyed that long and weird rant.
